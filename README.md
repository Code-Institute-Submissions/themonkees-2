# The Monkees

This project was specifically designed for a music band in order
to facilitate interaction with actual and potential fans. All the
important information is in a maximum two clicks reach.


## UX
This website is for a music band. Main goal is to reach actual and potential fans who may also want to hire the band for their events.

* All the links related to the main two groups are in maximum 2 clicks reach. 

* Callout section is visible on every page it makes it easier to contact the band.

* Navigate section in the Footer facilitates acces to Audio/Video files, Contact Information as well as Social Links, 
  so when a User reaches the bottom of the website on a mobile device they don't have to go back to the top.

### User Stories
1. I am a fan. My goal is to see the upcoming events of my favourite band. The landing page shows these events with dates and location. 
   I could also listen to some music accesible from Music section or Audi/Video in Footers Navigate section.

2. I am a fan. My goal is to hire my favourite band for an event. I cand do this clicking on the Contact section or directly from the callout section by clickin on the button.

3. I am a potential fan. My goal is to discover more about the band. On the landing page, first thing on top, is a short description of the band, with a button bellow leading to more information if I'm interested.
   I could also listen to some music accesible from Music section or Audio/Video in Footers Navigate section in order to get an idea about the music they make.

## Testing
In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

Contact form:
Go to the "Contact Us" page
Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.
In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

##Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:

Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
Different configuration files?
Separate git branch?
In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
